    <p>This is the 7th lab for GIS 3410, Web Mapping, from MSU Denver</p>
   <h1>My Lab4 Web Page: Discover Estes Park!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my interactive map of Estes Park, one of my favorite places in the world! Below you'll find a few key locations that make this town so special:</p>
    
    <h3>1. The Large Circle: Estes Park Town</h3>
    <p>The large red circle on the map represents the entire town of Estes Park. Surrounded by the breathtaking Rocky Mountains, Estes Park is a charming town that draws visitors from all over the world, especially those heading to Rocky Mountain National Park. The circle covers the main areas of town, including the bustling downtown, the picturesque streets lined with shops and restaurants, and the scenic riverwalks along the Big Thompson River.</p>

    <h3>2. The Polygon: The Stanley Hotel</h3>
    <p>Next up is the Stanley Hotel, located inside the polygon. This historic hotel is world-famous for its role in inspiring Stephen King's novel *The Shining*. The Stanley Hotel, built in 1909, is a sprawling Victorian structure with a rich history. It offers tours that tell the eerie stories and legends of the hotel, as well as its role in popular culture. The Stanley's spooky ambiance, combined with its location in the shadow of the majestic mountains, makes it a must-visit attraction for those who enjoy history, horror, and a little bit of the supernatural!</p>

    <h3>3. The Point: Estes Park Town Hall</h3>
    <p>Finally, you'll see a marker pinpointing the Estes Park Town Hall, located at the heart of the town. This building serves as the civic hub of Estes Park and houses various local government offices. It also features a small museum that showcases the town's rich history and its growth from a quiet mountain village to a tourist destination. The museum offers a glimpse into Estes Park's founding, the arrival of tourists, and the development of the area over time. It's a great place to learn more about the town and its heritage.</p>
